  I. Concept

      Tiers
         Reading frames
         Constant height


 II. tview commands

      0. data:  numeric
                range
                tier_spec
                string     xyz or "this is a string"

      A. Parameter definining commands (many of these can be overriden by 
         command line options below)

         These are preprocessed, and if they occur multiple times, only
         the last one counts.  Many of these can be overridden by command
         line options.

          symmetric on|off
          scale a b                          - initial scale, overridden by 
          tiers nabove nbelow height spacing - 
          wtitle                            - window title

      B. Drawing commands

          tier coordinate is
              (t x-spec y-spec)

          t_hline (t x-spec y-spec)
          t_vline (t x-spec y-spec)
          t_rect (t x-spec y-spec)

      C. Mouse event handling commands

          Very crude and primitive right now

      D. Key-commands

          r - refresh
          o - zoom out to full scale
          q - quit
