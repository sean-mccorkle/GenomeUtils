                               -------------

                   
String positions - icon positions

    Reading frames designations:  
            F1,
            F2,
            F3, 
            R1, 
            R2, 
            R3

Input/Output
------------

    Most of these programs take combined input from files, and generate
    ascii output on stdout:

           program [options]  a b c

    reads all input from file a, then file b, then c.  A hyphen can be
    used to specify stdin in place of a file:

           program  a - b

    reads all of file a, then ALL stdin till EOF, then all of file b.
    If no files are given, stdin is scanned.   These are designed to work 
    as Unix filters.

    Note that in the case of fasta input sequences, the sequence may 
    NOT span the break of two files.  That is,

           program  a b

    assumes that the first line of b is the start of a new FASTA sequence.
    If for some bizzare reason you really NEED to break a sequence over a 
    file boundary, you can do:

           cat a b | program


File formats
------------

    BNL modified fasta format input (wide acceptance):

            ; comment lines
            123 aaabb cccde   optional numbers at beginning of line, optional
                              spaces

    Strict FASTA output.  Use pp to make this easier to read.


Graphics Commands interpreted by view:
-------------------------------------

    t_hline  <t>  <x1> <x2> <y>  <color>
    t_vline  <t>  <x>  <y1> <y2> <color>
    t_rect   <t>  <x1> <x2> <y1> <y2>  <color>
    lpress   <t>  <x1> <x2> <y1> <y2>
    #  comments

where

    <t> is a tier number, 1, 2, 3, ... or -1, -2, -3, ...
    <x>, <x1>,<x2> are horiztontal postitions in BASE PAIRS (bp)
    <y>, <y1>,<y2> are vertical positions WITHIN the tier (0.0-1.0)
