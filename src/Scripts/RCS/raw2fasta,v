@Here's an attempt at a simpler, more portable FASTA formatter.

# Program:        raw2fasta
# Programmer:     Sean R. McCorkle
# Language:       perl
# Description:    converts one or more raw Mac sequence files (Sequencher 
#                 text files) into a single output of FASTA format sequences.
#
# Usage:          raw2fasta  [<file> ...]
#
#                 each file specified on the command line is opened and 
#                 converted to FASTA format and written to standard output.
#                 Its assumed that each file contains one sequence only.
#                 The filenames are used as ">" header titles for each seq.
#                 If no file is specified, stdin is scanned.
