This is a collection of unix command line program and script utitlities for processing DNA, RNA and protein sequences.  Many of these read naturally from files specified as command line arguments or from stdin when no arguments or given, and typically write output on standard out.   They are intended to be usable in unix pipes.   

Most of these read and write sequence data in fasta format.  Many will operate on DNA, RNA and protein sequences, some work only on nucleotides and some on protein sequences.

*See master branch for current software and documentation.  This branch contains __a lot__ of programs which have been dropped because they're obsolete.*
